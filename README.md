# SCBW-Bot

This is a fully-functional StarCraft AI that plays zerg. It uses BWAPI and is a modified version of Steamhammer 1.2.3 by Jay Scott (http://satirist.org/ai/starcraft/steamhammer/).

Notable changes include improved worker & base management, flyer research for mutalisks, more varied strategy, and support for defilers.
